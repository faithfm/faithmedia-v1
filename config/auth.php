    | mechanisms used by this application to persist your user's data.
    |
    | Our faithfm/laravel-auth0-pattern package renames the default Laravel guards 
    | for clarity, searchability, and disambiguation with route middleware naming:
    |   * 'web' guard is renamed to 'ffm-session-guard'
    |   * 'api' guard is renamed to 'ffm-token-guard'

    | generating more password reset tokens. This prevents the user from
    | quickly generating a very large amount of password reset tokens.

    | Authorization Permissions List   (Faith FM laravel-auth0-pattern)

    | The list of authorization permissions recognised by the application

    |
    | Faith FM laravel-simple-permissions automatically creates Gates for all permissions 
    | defined here.  (See: SimplePermissionsServiceProvider.php)
    |
    | Ie: permissions applied in the 'user_permissions' table must be defined here
    | before they will be available for Authorization in the application.
    |
    | Gates can be used in controllers, views, etc - ie: Gate::allows('edit-catalog')
    | For more information see README.md and https://laravel.com/docs/master/authorization
    | 
    | Our pattern allows for multiple permissions to be checked in a single gate using the '|' character.
    | Ie: Gate::allows('view-catalog|edit-catalog').  This works in middleware 'can' checks as well.
